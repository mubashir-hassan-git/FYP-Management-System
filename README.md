A web-based platform designed to automate and streamline the complete lifecycle of Final Year Projects (FYP) — from proposal submission to final evaluation.

## Overview

The FYP Management System addresses the inefficiencies of manual FYP management at Namal University. Currently, project proposals, group formations, and supervisor assignments are managed through Excel sheets and manual communication, which is time-consuming and error-prone.

This system provides a centralized, automated platform where students, supervisors, coordinators, and administrators can efficiently manage FYPs.

## Key Features

- Proposal submission and approval workflow
- Student group management
- Supervisor and co-supervisor assignment
- Progress tracking and feedback
- Role-based access control
- Centralized project repository
- Evaluation and reporting management

## Problem Statement

Managing FYPs manually at Namal University has become increasingly difficult with the growing number of students and projects each year. Manual coordination through Excel and paper-based systems leads to:

- Data duplication and inconsistency
- Delayed approvals and progress monitoring
- Increased workload for coordinators and supervisors

The FYP Management System automates these processes to ensure efficiency, transparency, and consistency.

## Objectives

- Automate the complete FYP lifecycle from proposal submission to evaluation
- Provide role-based user access for students, supervisors, and administrators
- Maintain a centralized record of all FYPs
- Ensure scalability to handle large numbers of users

## System Architecture

The system follows a three-tier architecture:

1. Frontend (React.js)
2. Backend (Node.js with Express.js)
3. Database (MySQL)
