Overview

The Final Year Project (FYP) Management System is a web-based application designed to automate the complete lifecycle of final year projects at Namal University This system addresses the inefficiencies and challenges of the current manual process, which relies heavily on Excel sheets and manual coordination.

The system streamlines all phases of FYP management, including:

1) Proposal submission
2) Supervisor and co-supervisor assignment
3) Student group formation
4) Progress tracking and feedback
5) Final evaluation
6) centralizing and automating these processes, the system reduces duplication, ensures consistency, and improves efficiency for all stakeholders.



Problem Statement

Managing FYPs manually at Namal University has become increasingly complex due to the growing number of students and projects each year. Manual processes for forming groups, assigning supervisors, reviewing proposals, and monitoring progress are time-consuming, prone to errors, and stressful for coordinators, faculty, and students.

There is no centralized system to ensure proper tracking, role-based access, and accurate record-keeping, leading to inefficiencies and delays in project development.



Objectives

The main objectives of the FYP Management System are:

1) Automate the entire FYP management process from group formation to final evaluation.
2) Provide role-based access for students, supervisors, coordinators, and administrators.
3) Maintain a centralized record of all past and present FYPs.
4) Ensure scalability to handle a large number of users.

Software Development Methodology

The project uses the **Agile Scrum Methodology** for development.

1) Work is divided into small, manageable sprints.
2) Continuous feedback from stakeholders ensures functional modules are designed and improved iteratively.
3) Agile allows flexibility for requirement changes without delaying progress.
4) Focuses on reducing risk, improving quality, and maintaining stakeholder satisfaction throughout the project lifecycle.



Features

1) Proposal submission and approval workflow
2) Supervisor and co-supervisor assignment
3) Student group management
4) Progress tracking and feedback
5) Role-based access control
6) Centralized project repository
7) Reporting and evaluation management
