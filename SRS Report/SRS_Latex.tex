\subsection{Non-Functional Requirements}
Non-functional requirements of the Final Year Project Management System (FYPMS) provide  a  attributes that  shows how  system will ensure  scalability,efficiency, security, responsiveness and reliability in academic part. These requirements  support a large number of users  including students, faculty members, coordinators  and administrators in Final Year Project phase.




\subsubsection{Usability Requirements}
Usability requirements makes FYPMS easy to understand and use for technical and non-technical users.


\paragraph{User-Friendly}
The system should provide web-based interface accessible with browsers. All the tasks like submitting proposals, reviewing documents, and assigning evaluators should  reachable in less  steps. Clear labels, navigation and logical workflows should make less user confusion.

\paragraph{Accessibility}
The system should have accessibility features like fonts which are able to read, use well and proper color contrast, and good navigation. All system messages  should  present in proper manner and understandable to users with different technical expertise level. 


\subsubsection{Reliability Requirements}
Reliability is essential to maintain trust in academic records and evaluation processes.

\paragraph{Availability}
The FYPMS should maintain an availability of 99 percent out of 100 percent or higher during the academic year. Scheduled maintenance should be planned outside critical academic periods where possible.


\paragraph{Data Integrity}
All system transactions should be processed reliably to prevent data loss or duplication. Project records, evaluation marks, and the approvals should remain consistent across system sessions. The system shall ensure that incomplete or failed operations do not corrupt stored data.

\paragraph{Backup and Recovery}
The system should make backup of data to protect the previous task after failure. In case of system failure, data should be recoverable within an acceptable time frame defined by university policy. Backup data should  protect from illegal users.


\subsubsection{Performance Requirements}
Performance requirements ensure that the FYPMS delivers smooth and timely system responses during normal and peak academic workloads, such as proposal submission deadlines and evaluation periods.

\paragraph{Response Time}
System responsiveness is the main thing that provide system operation time efficiency. Normal response time for  user tasks such as login, viewing project details, or accessing evaluation schedules and should not exceed 2 seconds under normal running conditions and when  time consuming  operations like uploading project documents  should be done in 5 seconds, depending on file and network connectivity. During peak time when user submit  like proposal submission deadlines or final evaluations, system response time should not  degraded by more than 15 percent compared to normal conditions.


\paragraph{Concurrent User Support}
The FYPMS is mainly designed to support concurrent access by the multiple stakeholders. The system should support at least 2,000 active users simultaneously, including students, supervisors, evaluators, and also coordinators. Concurrent access to  the shared resources such as the main  project documents and evaluation schedules should not cause system crashes or any kind of data inconsistency. Load management mechanisms should ensure stable performance during the high-usage periods.


\paragraph{Data Throughput}
Efficient handling of the sensitive academic data is essential for smooth system operation. The system should handle all kind of multiple concurrent database transactions related to project submissions, approvals, and evaluations without any noticeable delays. The document uploads, including proposal files and final reports, should support file sizes defined by university policy while maintaining acceptable upload performance. Notification processing (announcements, deadline alerts) should be delivered to users without  any significant delay.


\paragraph{Peak Load Handling}
System should handle the load of operations when use peak time like submission files during near deadlines. Servers and database has multiple paths to handle the users. This time other users access the their modules activities normally.
\subsection{Scalability Requirements}
Security requirements are to protect sensitive academic and personal information either it is about the involved members or about the project.
\paragraph{Enhancement of System}
The FYPMS should support increasing numbers of students, projects, and academic sessions without major redesign. The system architecture shall allow future enhancements, such as integration with other university systems.


\paragraph{Modular Design}
The system should be designed in such manner that new features can  added in method not effect the functionality. Single modules (student management, evaluation, administration) should work independently to enhance maintainability.
\subsubsection{Security Requirements}
Security requirements protect sensitive academic and personal information.

\paragraph{Authentication and Authorization}
Users should authenticate using university-provided credentials. Role-based access control should bound the functions  to user permissions or roles  such that student,supervisor,coordinator,admin. There should get access of data to authorized user.


\paragraph{Data Protection}
Important data like passwords and evaluation results should store it securely and provide protection. Data movement between users and system shall protected from unauthorized access.


\paragraph{Privacy and Compliance}
The system should comply with university data protection and privacy policies. Access to student academic data shall be limited to authorized academic personnel only.
